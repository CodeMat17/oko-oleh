      "It is difficult for me to explain how much you meant to me. I understand that death is inevitable, yet, it was difficult for me to be able to put words into writing. I am not ashamed to say no man I met was my husband’s equal and I never loved any other man as much. The many years we spent together is an unshakable proof even though it was not smooth and rosy.",
      "He was the best father to all my children. Imperial encouraged them greatly in their academic pursuit. He was a courageous man, fearless, welcomed challenges, and always stood for what he believed in.",
      "Imperial was a journalist of national and international repute. His career, and my life together with his started in Ibadan from there to Enugu, to Lagos, Liberia, Abia, and Ebonyi State; this movement was not easy for me and my children. I know now, that’s the way God ordained my life with him.",
      "We endured till his sad departure. He promised us he would live long, perhaps God did grant us the grace. But being human and having lived long with our loved ones, saying the final goodbye is difficult.",
      "Imperial was a hero anyone would like to have. He loved to talk about his notable achievements and those of his (children’s) family. He was a historian and rarely forgot things. He positively hated failures or perceived weakness and would tell you in person not minding the people around.",
      "Imperial, ‘We never believed the strong arm of death would defeat you as you barely fell ill in all the years I spent with you”. We believe then that your illness had to do with age as diagnosed by the doctors. My husband your passing away is a great loss and a scar to me. Despite the legacy you left behind, your memory will drive me forward. For death, has finally robbed me of a veritable voice, my hero and enlightening soul. Your legacy will live on”.",

I am going to miss a lot of stories that you share with us about your life experiencesI saw the war through your stories about your experiences teaching us lots of lessons. You taught me to be strong and how to take risks. As a soldier, you saw the horrors that mankind is capable of inflicting upon one another.",
      "You shielded us from the harsh realities of the world and always putting us your children’s well being above your own. You stood by me through thick and thin especially when i had crisis offering me guidance and support when i needed it most. Your bravery and resilience have always inspired me to be a better person, to be strong and never lose hope in the face of adversity. You always told me that failure is never an option.",
      "You were my first teacher, i will never forget the novels and storybooks that you bought for me at the age of four, you taught me how to read at a tender age. You inculcated the culture of reading in our lives very early and you extended it to your grandchildren which is playing out in our lives today.",

      "He was a rarity in the real world where dominance, oppression, dishonesty, and corruption are endemic. He was a bearer of timeless wisdom born out of his experiences.",

      "Since you left, I can't help but rush to my phone, hoping against hope that you'd call me, as you always did, day and night, just to say, “Ucha nwamu.” How I miss our conversations about the political happenings in the country, always ending with your trademark “Cheers.”",
      "Mama wishes you could see her now. Iyke is doing his best to fill your shoes, Ebe has become a consultant, Ngo is still the trailblazing lawyer, and Ugo is making his mark on the world stage. Your grandchildren miss you terribly. Even Mum says the house is too quiet without you.",
      "When Plato said, “You should not honour men more than truth,” he must have been speaking of you. That was your gospel. Everyone who knew you understood that you always spoke your mind without hesitation, a trait I’ve inherited from you. Your kind of audacity is rare, which is probably why you were chosen to lead the Nigerian Team of Journalists to ECOMOG, and also why the then military Governor of Ebonyi State retrenched you, withholding your pension for years because you refused to compromise your integrity. You feared no man, only God, always reminding us that only God could take your life.",
      "You believed you had direct access to God, your prayers straightforward and sincere, like one gentleman speaking to another. Sometimes, when I share stories about you, people find them hard to believe—because only a legend could have lived the way you did.They don't make your kind anymore.",
      "You were immensely proud of your children, always singing our praises to anyone who would listen, and even to those who wouldn’t. That’s probably why we kept some things from you. You sacrificed everything to ensure we got the best of everything, especially in our education. I remember when you had four of us in university at the same time, despite your pension being withheld. It was a tough season, but you never gave up. I felt the struggle the most, being so far from home, but your unwavering strength kept us all going.",
      "You were the man who disciplined without the rod. A man of many sides, you could be playing and dancing with us one moment, and in the next, wearing your stern disciplinarian look. No one dared to make a grammatical mistake around you—you could catch it even in your sleep. This sharpened all of us. Your sense of humour was unmatched, often leaving those who only saw the surface utterly confused.",
      "I remember your last chest X-ray, the doctor pointing to the bullets lodged in your rib—a final confirmation of the tales of the Biafran war that shaped our childhood. Your strength was extraordinary, and illness seemed foreign to you. That’s why I was so fearful the first time I heard you were sick because “Dad never falls sick.” And of course, you denied it, even when it was obvious. You didn’t want anyone to take care of you or feel pity for you, which is why you quickly returned to the other side within a few months of falling ill.",
      "It’s your strength that gives me the courage to mourn you. Whenever I feel like crying, I hear your voice, “Agu anaga amu odu”—a lion does not beget a sheep—or “I did not raise weak children.”",

      "I know you’re in heaven now, enjoying all the things you love—ekwu, okazi, inghara ya anu. Especially anu. I’m glad that was the last thing you ate before journeying to the other side. I found solace in our last moments together a few months before you left. ",

    name: "Your Dr. Ebe",
    content: [
      "Dad made extra-ordinary impact as a husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, veteran journalist and elder statesman. He embodied diligence, determination, honesty, integrity, sacrifice and generosity. He was a great leader, a true nationalist and a patriot. ",
      "Despite being orphaned at a young age with no steady sponsor, he rose to the peak of his career becoming the pioneer Director General of Ebonyi State Broadcasting Corporation (EBBC). There was no impossibility in his dictionary and this, he translated to his children and his protégés. A veteran journalist who was passionate about his career and dedicated to his nation, he led a crew of journalists to cover the Liberian civil war under the ECOMOG; for which he was yet to be adequately compensated for till his demise. One of his favourite quotes was ‘the pen is mightier than the sword’. He used his craft to bring development to communities around him, an act that earned him the chieftaincy title ‘Akaraka Isingwu’. He was an elder statesman and contributed to the development of Ehugbo and South-eastern Nigeria as a whole. His books the River Monarchy and the Biafran war told the stories of the Biafran war and the Afikpo community in a beautiful way. Having survived two wars as a Biafran soldier and a journalist, we typically refer to him as a hero of two wars. He embodied integrity and honesty, qualities that made some to love him and some to resent him as he will always say the truth no matter whose ox is gored. These qualities made him to be compulsorily retired as General Manager because of his determination not to compromise these standards. His courage to do the right thing even during a military administration is worthy of emulation. We did pay for it as he was denied pension for years during the time four of us were in the university but he never regretted his decision to stand for truth. We are grateful to all who came to our aid during those trying periods. Dad was generous to a fault; he could give out his entire savings to a relative or a friend in need. He also had an unwavering trust in God and his favourite song was ‘Jesus shall reign where’er the sun’. I often find myself singing it when I encounter difficult circumstances.",
      "Finally, he was a super-dad. Though a disciplinarian, his love and sacrifice for his children shone through. He gave up every comfort to ensure that we had quality education. He created time to teach us and enrolled us in lessons far ahead of our class. Having five daughters, he believed in the empowerment of the girl-child and that gender should not be a limitation. He encouraged us to be the best and instilled confidence in us. No one ‘hypes’ the way my dad does. ",
      "Therefore, losing him on March 11th, 2024, was like having one’s key support pulled suddenly from one’s feet. I was preparing for my fellowship exam in May and was looking forward to the usual pre-exam encouragement and ‘hyping’ as well as sharing the news of my success with him. Having to face the exam without this support was the most difficult thing I had ever done in my life. It felt sad that he wasn’t alive to witness the completion of my residency training as he was my number one cheerleader on the journey to becoming a surgeon.",
      "Dad, it would have been great to still have many years with you on this earth but 85 years is not a joke and you deserve your rest. You have fought the good faith and have finished the race. Now you live forever in our hearts and our lives through the extra-ordinary impact you have made, till we meet again on resurrection morning. ",

      "Dear Dad",
      'March 11" was undoubtedly the worst day of my life. Death did me dirty by taking you away, creating a loophole and a void in my heart that can never be filled. While I knew death was inevitable to all, I just thought God would have spared you a few more years to enjoy the fruit of your labour. But then again, God knows the best. You laboured assiduously and gave it your all to see that I and my siblings attain the most significant expression of our potential. In my success story, you were the centre. As far back as 1993, you knew I would one day be an astute lawyer, so you bought me the book, `The Wizard of Law`. I recall wanting to study petroleum engineering because I wanted to be rich, and you downrightly told me that I was destined to be a lawyer. I didn`t study petroleum engineering thanks to you, but it was a win-win because I am a petroleum lawyer. How could I forget the level of love, tolerance and faith you had for and in me? Despite your lofty place as a Director, you will still come home and wash my uniform until SS2 when I was too ashamed to allow that to happen. You would review my notes and academic progression. This you did even after I finished my master`s degree in law. Your carrot-and-stick method of parenting was your pedagogy. You were highly paradoxical. Tough yet very loving; bad-mouthed but had the kindest heart; disciplinarian yet very emphatic. People complained that you were very high-handed and bad-mouthed. Still, you were perfect to me because your flaws complimented your strengths. Beneath your seeming shenanigans was a very kind and generous soul who was intentional and did raise trailblazers including three best-graduating students and, numerous first-class degree holders.',
      "Recall, when I graduated from university, I wowed you with a first-class; things could have been better for you regarding finances. You told me that you would borrow money from the Ezi-Agbi Community purse and were willing to use your certificate(s) as collateral. In your yesteryears, even when your cognitive abilities began to decline, you were still the very one I would want to hear from at my lowest point because your words always resonated with so much positivity and hope that I will one day become all that I dreamt of. You will always end each conversation with `Ngo D Law, Great Child, I am proud of you`. In parenting, you were simply the best, not because you were perfect by every standard but because vou gave it your all. You were, and still are, a feminist. A man who, by the accomplishments of the female children, made and is still making an unequivocal statement that a female, too, can become the Greatest of All Time (GOAT).",
      "I'am sorry, Dad, sincerely sorry that I couldn't even repay you for your years of sacrifice for me and my siblings. I am sad I didn't spoil you as silly as I intended. Forgive me for not getting you the choicest things in life. I didn’t know you would die this year, I guess I just thought you were immortal. But even though you are not immortal, your legacies certainly are. In our last conversation, I asked what I would do for you. You told me that you didn’t need anything other than my realising the highest expression of my potential. Here I am telling you that I will make you proud. I will exhaust every option to become more than you have ever dreamed I could be (by the grace of God).",

I was bullied in Nursery school, so much that I forgot everything I had learnt. My dad taught me everything again and rebuilt my confidence. He taught me that I could be anything I wanted and that there was no limit to what I could strive for. He was more than just a father; he was my biggest cheerleader, teacher, and hero.",
      "My father was my greatest champion. He taught me the invaluable lessons of self-belief and perseverance. With unwavering support, he instilled in me the courage to pursue my dreams without fear. When I told him I wanted to study Computer Engineering at Michael Okpara University, he supported me completely. His guidance ignited a spark within me, encouraging me to question the world around me and to forge my own path. These teachings are the foundation upon which I’ve built my life.",
      "When my dad said I didn’t need to worry about something, I knew I didn’t have to worry because he always kept his word. When I was doing my undergraduate program, I always had emergency money, just enough to get home to my dad because whatever the problem was, if I could get to him then I would be fine. He was my Polaris: even in the darkest night out in the scary sea of life, he was always there to guide me home.",
      "I remember some time last year when my dad asked for my account details and I didn’t want to send it because like I had said to him, it wasn’t necessary. He called my husband to demand for my account details. Such was my father’s love for me, that even in old age, he worried about me. He always called to ask if I was getting on fine and if I needed anything. His calls always brightened my day and he would always end them by telling me how proud he was. I was his eagle, his pride.",
      "Beyond the grand lessons of life, my Dad taught me the art of finding joy in simplicity. His tales of market adventures, filled with laughter and a touch of playful competitiveness, were a testament to his ability to cherish life’s little victories. I remember how he would come home from the market with tales about how he wrestled the last udara from enthusiastic mums telling them it was for his children. Or how he would declare, “Good food!”, when he ate a meal he loved. He showed me that the greatest treasures often lie in the ordinary moments.",
      "I am eternally grateful for the countless lessons you imparted, Dad. Your wisdom was the compass that guided me through life’s journey. From the courage to pursue my dreams to the joy of simple pleasures, your teachings have shaped me into the person I am today. Thank you for being my constant source of inspiration, for loving me unconditionally, and for your unwavering belief in me. Your calls, filled with pride and encouragement, were a constant source of strength. I will cherish those memories forever.",

Those discussions were more than just conversations; they were lessons in leadership, patriotism, and the complexities of life. I will miss those dialogues, as they were a significant part of our bond.",

Throughout that visit, you kept singing the song "Nkanu Ebuka - Nkanu Ebuka," a melody that will forever echo in my heart. Before we left, you prayed for me with a depth and intensity that I had never experienced before. Little did I know that it was your final blessing, your last gift to me before your journey to the world beyond.',

You exemplified this when you stood up to a sitting military administrator of a state when you were the pioneer General manager of Ebonyi Broadcasting Corporation because you wanted the right thing to be done. Of course, you passed this trait to your children as my wife doesn’t tolerate indiscipline. You were also a family man – one who loved children. You told me you wanted more grandchildren.

      "I first met my brother-in-law Imperial in 1985, when he moved with his family to Enugu. I knew he had a distinguished record of service in the civil war and my husband had the highest regard for him. So I was not surprised to see a very fit and active-looking gentleman who looked as though he would carry out anything he set his mind to without letting anything stand in his way.",
      "“This is the lady I’ve been waiting to meet”, he said, and this was typical of his positive attitude to every new circumstance. I felt at once that he had a genuine regard for me, as I had for him.",
      "Over the next years, as our families spent time together, I learned more of his character. He never seemed to be disturbed or worried by anything and was ready for every challenge. This confidence extended to taking on his employers at Radio Enugu. He was employed as a newsreader in English, but at a stage he was told to read the news in Igbo – something that he had no practice in. Rather than protesting that this was not reasonable, he went ahead without hesitation and the result convinced his bosses that he should be returned to the English-language service with immediate effect.",
      "Later in the early 1990s he was sent to Liberia to report on the ECOWAS mission to bring about a ceasefire and a peace settlement to the civil war. When this mission failed and the country reverted to war, it was a dangerous time to be in Liberia, but he was not the man to feel fear.",
      "I also remember him as a devoted father who would provide for his children no matter what. He gave an example of confidence, competence and firmness of character which must have made a deep impression on them in their early years. Although it is many years now since I last saw him, his is a character I will never forget.",

Imperial you saw and fought two wars; namely- the Nigerian civil war you fought on the side of Biafra as an Army Officer. Thereafter, you were posted to Liberia war front as a Journalist by the Nigerian government.",
      "In all that, you survived both wars. Is on record that you had bullet wounds around your chest which left some bullet pellets in your body for fifty three years(53 ) years (1968 to 2021) without any known indications  of health breakdown resulting from the bullet pellets in your body system.",
      "After 53years, Six(6) number of the bullet pellets came out of your body on their own without any medical actions on your body system that was actually a divine intervention. The above experiences confirmed your divine health and divine protections. Death came at a time it was destined to come.",
      "Apart from the fact that the passing to the next life of Oko Agbi Oleh (imperial), is one of the big loses to Nigeria, Eboni state, Ehugbo, Ukpa and Eziagbi. It is extremely great loss to the OLEFORUH’s family. We know that the death of human being is irreplaceable. We feel the loss of every person who is dear or related to us. Yet , the fact is that every death do not afflict us in the same way. Some are more hurtful and more painful than others. Some affect our views, perceptions or attitudes to life more than others. It may be because we wish we had been in a position that would have helped us to save our loved ones. It may also be because we were in a position to do something and give everything at our disposal but still lost the person. Whichever way, it is humanly very painful to lose our relatives or friends.",
      "Life is a mystery to be lived; not something to be understood, not a problem to be solved. All we need is the wisdom to lead our lives the way we see it because there are no guarantees in life. We just have to love and enjoy the time we are allowed to be alive on earth. Life by it’s nature involves constant change and motion and whether we recognise it or not, there is no alternative. We are constantly changing and moving towards the end. So the wife and children of Oko Agbi Oleh (imperial) have no choice than to accept it in good faith and be strong in the lord.",
      "It is very, very important to state here and clear that Chief Oko Oleh (imperial) has always stood tall and firm in all critical issues affecting the Oleforuh’s family. Infact nobody can take away the spirit of uprightness and frankness from him during his sojourn on earth. He was strong and courageous.",

I recall with nostalgia the response he gave when we all converged in his office in the newsroom of Radio Nigeria Enugu to welcome him and he said and I quote “Mkpurukem has done it”, referring to his village deity.",

Late Oko Ole protested saying that he had never read news in Igbo language but the powers that be insisted that he must comply. On that faithful day when it was his turn to read the news on air. He simply translated the news in Ehugbo (Afikpo) dialect and when he was given the green light, he gave the time check in Afikpo dialect and followed it up with “Alaa Ehugbo unu jookwa, onye un una anu olu e………….. and so on.",
