      "It is difficult for me to explain how much you meant to me. I understand that death is inevitable, yet, it was difficult for me to be able to put words into writing. I am not ashamed to say no man I met was my husband’s equal and I never loved any other man as much. The many years we spent together is an unshakable proof even though it was not smooth and rosy.",
      "He was the best father to all my children. Imperial encouraged them greatly in their academic pursuit. He was a courageous man, fearless, welcomed challenges, and always stood for what he believed in. ",
      "Imperial was a journalist of national and international repute. His career, and my life together with his started in Ibadan from there to Enugu, to Lagos, Liberia, Abia, and Ebonyi State; this movement was not easy for me and my children. I know now, that’s the way God ordained my life with him.",
      "We endured till his sad departure. He promised us he would live long, perhaps God did grant us the grace. But being human and having lived long with our loved ones, saying the final goodbye is difficult.",
      "Imperial was a hero anyone would like to have. He loved to talk about his notable achievements and those of his (children’s) family. He was a historian and rarely forgot things. He positively hated failures or perceived weakness and would tell you in person not minding the people around. ",
      "Imperial, ‘We never believed the strong arm of death would defeat you as you barely fell ill in all the years I spent with you”. We believe then that your illness had to do with age as diagnosed by the doctors. My husband your passing away is a great loss and a scar to me. Despite the legacy you left behind, your memory will drive me forward. For death, has finally robbed me of a veritable voice, my hero and enlightening soul. Your legacy will live on”. ",
