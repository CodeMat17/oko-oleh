              Birth and Early Life
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Chief Oko Oleh was born into the humble family of Oko Agbi Oleh and
            Ogeri Oko Oleh in Ezi Agbi, Ukpa Village, Afikpo North of Ebonyi
            State. The second child and first son of four siblings, Oko Oleh,
            was destined for greatness from an early age. Tragically, his life
            was marked by the loss of both parents at a tender age—his mother
            passed away when he was just seven years old, and his father died
            when he was thirteen. Despite these challenges, Chief Oko
            Oleh&apos;s brilliance shone through, propelling him to remarkable
            achievements.

              Education and Early Achievements
            </h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            A child prodigy, Chief Oko Oleh, began his formal education early,
            attending Government Primary School, Afikpo. His extraordinary
            intelligence earned him a distinction in Standard 6, making him the
            best student in the entire old Ogoja province. However, the death of
            his parents left him without financial support for further
            education. His teacher, a compassionate whiteman, organized a
            meeting of Oko Oleh’s kinsmen to solicit funds for his secondary
            education. Unfortunately, the plea was unsuccessful. Determined to
            succeed, Oko Oleh went to live with his teacher, Aqua Isua, and
            attended Macgregor Teacher’s Training College in Afikpo, where he
            obtained Teachers Grade Three and Two certificates with flying
            colors.

            Despite not attending a formal secondary school, Chief Oko Oleh’s
            insatiable thirst for knowledge led him to write the London General
            Certificate of Education (GCE) in 1967. He passed with exceptional
            results, surpassing his peers worldwide, especially in English
            Language, earning him the nickname &quot;Imperial Majesty&quot; among his
            friends and peers. This achievement was so extraordinary that he
            received a telegram congratulating him with the message,
            “congratulations most English.”
